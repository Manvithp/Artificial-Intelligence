# Housing Price Prediction

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model that predicts house prices based on various property features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant factors. The model analyzes historical housing data to learn patterns and provide accurate price predictions.
