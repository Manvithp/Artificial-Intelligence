# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning implementation that predicts house prices based on property features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The objective is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate house prices using real-world housing data.

---

## Objective
To develop and evaluate a regression model that predicts house prices based on input features and performs well on unseen data.
