# Artificial-Intelligence

This repository contains my AI and other subsets of AI projects created to demonstrate
my understanding of the concepts and practical implementation.

Each project is organized in a separate folder and includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook with code, outputs, and visualizations
- A project-specific README is also been created.


More projects will be added as I continue learning and building.

## Purpose
This portfolio is intended for learning, practice, and interview showcase.
